Getting and Cleaning data assignment

Project name - Samsung Wearable device Measurement Data
The purpose of this project is to collect measurement data from the Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone, clean it, then produce a tidy data set for the mean measurement values
based on the subject and the type of activity performed.

The data was collected by SmartLabs. More information on the original data collection
can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

the run_analysis R script generates two data sets (refere to the codebook for details):
1. activity_data - tidy data set of wearable device measurements
2. activity_mean - tidy data set for the mean measurements grouped by subject and the activity
